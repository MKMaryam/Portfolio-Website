										<span class="icon solid major fa-code alt" style="color:rgb(240, 171, 183);"></span>
										<h3>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h3>
										<p>I have a solid foundation in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
											My skills in HTML enable me to structure and organize content effectively, 
											while my expertise in CSS allows me to create visually appealing and 
											responsive designs. I use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic 
											elements, enhancing user experience and bringing websites to life. With a
											 keen eye for detail and a passion for crafting seamless user interfaces, 
											 I strive to create web pages that are both functional and aesthetically 
											 pleasing.</p>

									<li>
										<span class="icon major brands fa-java alt" style="color:rgb(61, 90, 168);"></span>
										
										<h3>Java</h3>
										<p>I have a strong proficiency in Java, which I have utilized for various software development projects. My experience includes building 
											robust applications, understanding object-oriented programming principles, and implementing 
											efficient algorithms. Java's versatility allows me to work on a wide range of projects, from desktop 
											applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I enjoy leveraging Java's powerful libraries and frameworks to 
											create scalable and maintainable code.

										</p>

									<li>
										<span class="icon major brands fa-python alt" style="color: rgb(6, 133, 236);"></span>
										<h3>Python</h3>
										<p>I am relatively new to Python but have quickly gained a solid understanding of its syntax and capabilities.
											 Python's simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for rapid 
											 development and prototyping. I have started applying Python to automate 
											 tasks, analyze data, and explore machine learning concepts. As I continue 
											 to expand my knowledge and experience with Python, I am excited about the 
											 possibilities it offers for both web development and data science 
											 applications.</p>

										<h3 style="color:white;">University Course Registration System</h3>
										<p>Developed in Java, this system is designed to streamline the course 
											registration process for university students. The application 
											allows students to browse available courses, check prerequisites, 
											register for classes, and manage their schedules. It also includes 
											administrative features for managing course offerings and student
											 data, ensuring a seamless and efficient registration experience.</p>

									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon solid fa-seedling"></span>
										<br></br>
										<h3 style="color:white;">Greenhouse Technology Website</h3>
										<p>A responsive and visually appealing website developed using HTML, 
											CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a modern design with 
											interactive elements to provide information about advanced 
											greenhouse technologies. It includes features such as a blog 
											section, product gallery, and contact form, aimed at engaging 
											users and providing comprehensive insights into sustainable 
											agriculture practices.</p>
								    </li>

									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-regular fa-clock"></span>
										<br></br>
										<h3 style="color:white;">Time Tracker App</h3>
										<p>This ongoing project aims to create a versatile Time 
											Tracker App that helps users manage and track their 
											time effectively. The app will feature task management, 
											time logging, and reporting functionalities. It is being 
											designed with user-friendly interfaces and customizable 
											options. Potential programming languages and frameworks 
											for this project include Python (with Django or Flask for 
											the backend), JavaScript (with React Native for a mobile 
											app), or Swift (for an iOS app). The choice of language 
											will depend on the desired platform and features.</p>
